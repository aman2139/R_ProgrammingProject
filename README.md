# Nobel Insights: R Programming Exploration of Laureates Across Disciplines
## Introduction
Welcome to "Nobel Insights," a comprehensive exploration of Nobel Laureates and their remarkable contributions across various disciplines, meticulously crafted through the power of R programming. This project embarks on a journey to unravel the fascinating stories behind the laurels, utilizing data visualization techniques to present a dynamic and insightful narrative. With the help of R, a programming language and software environment commonly used for statistical computing and data analysis, we will embark on a voyage of exploration within this vast database.

**Key Features:**

1) **Interdisciplinary Exploration:** Dive deep into the laureates' achievements across disciplines such as Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, Literature, Peace, and Economics. Through the lens of R programming, witness the interconnectedness of excellence in diverse fields.

2) **Data-Driven Discoveries:** Leverage the capabilities of R to analyze and visualize datasets, unravelling patterns, trends, and correlations. Uncover the nuances of laureate demographics, distribution, and the evolution of recognition over time.

3) **Graphical Narratives:** Immerse yourself in a visual journey as R transforms raw data into meaningful graphs, charts, and plots. From scatter plots to bar graphs and pie charts, each visualization tells a compelling story of human achievement and progress.

4) **Coding:** Experience the power of R programming firsthand through the meticulously crafted code that drives the project. Engage with the codebase to understand the process of data manipulation, exploration, and visualization. 

5) **Insights:** Gain insights into which countries and institutions have made significant contributions to the realm of knowledge and peace. Explore the gender distribution of laureates and the impact of their work on a global scale.

## About Dataset
The dataset was taken from Kaggle, a renowned website among data enthusiasts. 

(Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sazidthe1/nobel-prize-data)

The data was tremendously cleaned before being worked on in R Studio. This dataset comprises columns like Full Name, Year of the Nobel Prize received, category, Gender, Date of birth, Country of birth, Death Date, Country of death, Name of organisation from where the winners belonged,	Country of organisation and so on.

The redundant values were cleaned, and only the relevant columns were kept to keep the analysis and coding simple and to the point. 

A new column of "Age_Received" was included which specified the age of the Nobel Prize winners at the time they were awarded. It was calculated by subtracting the year they received the Nobel Prize from their birth year. The organisations among the data set which received the Nobel Prize were also differentiated in the "Gender" column.
